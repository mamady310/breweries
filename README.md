# Introduction
This is the backend portion for a project that makes an API call for a list of breweries around the country. An API call is made for breweries then written to file system called data.json. The raw data is then run through a schema model to get the specific data points needed to create the website. That data is then stored on a mongoose database to then be used later for the front end portion.
